    <div class = "speech">I am a rising senior at American Indian Public High School in Oakland, California. I took an introductory computer science class at my school and found it fun, so I signed up for Girls Who Code to learn more programming languages. I wanted to make a
      website about recycling to help people learn how to recycle and reduce the waste that is building up in areas of nature around the world.</div>

    <div class = "speech">I am a rising junior at The College Preparatory School in Oakland. I heard about the Girls Who Code program through my school, and because I had always wanted to try coding out I thought that now was as good a time as any. I am very interested in saving
      the earth because at the moment it's the only place we can live, so why not make it as safe as possible and that's why recycling is important to me.</div>

    <div class = "speech">I walked into the creation of this website with the hope for a greener and happier world. I absolutely love nature; it has always played a huge part in my life, but it hurts me to see nature and life, including our own, suffer because of a lack in knowledge. I want to live in a world where people are conscious of their actions and how those actions affect the world around them. A world where sustainability and health are valued over turning a profit. And so, whether or not people choose to practice environmentally harmful habits, It is my hope that this resource will help shed a light on the great potential we have as human beings to break the cycle and be the change that this world so desperately needs.

This program is very helpful for girls like me to start learning computer technology. During this program, I became more and more interested in coding section. In my free time, I like to read comics, go camping with my friends and play games. I am interested in the environment, the pollution of nature and I plan to learn more about environment to help the nature.</div>
