      <p>Recycling is when rather than throwing something into a landfill, people give it to a facility to resort and reuse the materials. People should support recycling, because it can help the environment and make Earth a better home for us. By reusing
        the materials, we won't have to chop down more trees and make more plastic.

      </center>
      <p> Recycling is the easiest thing that we can do to help the environment as waste has a huge negative impact. For example, large amounts of energy are used when making products from raw materials. Recycling requires much less energy and therefore helps
        to preserve natural resources. Recycling is also important for humans because recycling can preserve natural resources for future generations that will reduce the need for raw materials, it also uses less energy, therefore preserving the natural
        resources for the future.

      </center>
      <p>Recycling is very helpful for us to save the earth and make a better home for us on this planet. The ways that recycling can help our planet are by minimizing pollution, preserving our natural resources, providing green jobs to people, and creating
        awareness and saves expenses and resources. Also sorting your recycling helps people pay attention to the amount of waste that they're producing.

          </center>
          <p>If anybody stops recycling now, maybe you wouldn't feel any immediate change but there would be a big impact in pollution. The other negative consequences of nobody recycling is landfills. By throwing everything away and not reusing or recycling it will cause the landfill to fill up. There are already islands completely made of trash in the ocean, and cities in third-world countries that are built on top of landfills, and an increase in landfill usage will just make more of these cities and islands. In 2003, 200 landfills in California will close, and rather than just having the waste float around, if it's recycled it can be put back to good use.
