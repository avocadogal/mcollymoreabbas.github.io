<img src="http://www.om-nanotech.com/images/Recycle.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width:13%;">
</center>
<p><q>When you recycle something, you process it so it can be used again.
  You might recycle an old tire and make it into a snazzy black knapsack with some very cool skid marks.
   The goal for recycle is to stop tossing out items that we can use again and again.
   It costs far less to recycle materials than it does to create new ones.
   As the technology offered improves those methods it becomes more cost effective and less time consuming for recycling efforts to be successful too.

        </center>
        <p><q>Recycling is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact on the world in which we live.
          Recycling is important to both the natural environment and us.
          We must act fast as the amount of waste we create is increasing all the time.

</center>
<p><q>People are now more aware of how recycling can help us improve our lives and save our natural resources.
  Every day, we dispose tons and tons of garbage.
  Before we end up losing our natural resources because of the ill effects of too much garbage,
  we should practice reusing and recycling materials.

        </center>
        <p><q>You as a person won’t see any difference in tomorrow if we all stopped recycling today.
          In fact, everything will seem normal. However, for the landfills there will be a huge impact.
          While not recycling or taking an interest in what happens to the environment may not hurt you now,
          but once you’re older 20/30 years it will.
          It will effect your children and your grandchildren like it has effected us now.

<h2><img class= leaf src="http://www.goodsuperfoods.com/images/leaf.svg?crc=4194303055" style="width:42px;height:42px;">How do I recycle ? </h2>
</center>
<p><q>Recycling conserves raw materials and saves the additional energy that manufacturers would use producing new products from scratch.
  Recycling also reduces the amount of material going into landfills,
  which is a big bonus given that many countries are fast running out of space for trash.
  Luckily, recycling is easy, and can quickly become part of your normal routine.
